<h1>My Project</h1>
<p>Hellooooo this bot has been a project of mine since April/23, <a href="https://github.com/Kathund">Kathund</a> was the first person that helped me making most of this code so thanks to him, I also got most of the code from discordjs.guides, since they have a large <a href="https://github.com/discordjs/guide/tree/main/code-samples">github repository</a> and <a href="https://discordjs.guide/">website</a> to help you make your first bot so again thanks to them I'm able to do this project of mine.</p>
