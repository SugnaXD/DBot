# My Project
Hellooooo this bot has been a project of mine since April/23, [Kathund](https://github.com/Kathund) was the first person that helped me making most of this code so thanks to him, I also got most of the code from discordjs.guides
since they have a large [github repository](https://github.com/discordjs/guide/tree/main/code-samples) and [website](https://discordjs.guide/) to help you make your first bot so again thanks to them I'm able to do this project of mine.

## Installation
Sources: [Discord.js Guides](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/)
Discordjs.guide has guides on setting up the basic node_modules if I start using diffrent Node Modules then I will make a seperate folder in the future.

## Usage
The Usage of this bot is simply because I wanted a shiny green bunch of pixels next to my name on Discord, I am going to edit this bot over the years as I find ways to make new features.
